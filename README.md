- Learning code for both work and hobby reasons. I would consider myself a creator as each hobby I have end ups creating things, whether it woodwork, electrical, 3d printing, and maybe even code if I can get the hang of it. I love sushi, poki, and enchiladas. I powerlift in my freetime, and any other time I have after that is for video games and anime.
